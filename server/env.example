# Database Configuration
# 
# LOCAL DEVELOPMENT: Use localhost
# HOSTINGER PRODUCTION: Use localhost (when server is on Hostinger, DB is local)
# HOSTINGER REMOTE (local dev connecting to Hostinger): Use MySQL hostname from hPanel
#
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_USER=your_database_username
DB_PASSWORD=your_database_password
DB_NAME=your_database_name
DB_PORT=3306

# Server Port

# HOSTINGER PRODUCTION: Check your Node.js app settings in hPanel (usually auto-assigned)

# Note: Copy this file to .env in the server folder
# For Hostinger production, use localhost for DB_HOST since the server runs on the same machine
